# Communicate Data Findings
In this project, I wanted to look at the characteristics of Ford GoBike system data covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The main focus was on days of the week, hours of the day, trip duration, user type, user age, and gender.
<br/>
It is was implemented using Python language, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy under Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity!

# Dataset
The dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
<br/>
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv).
<br/>
The dataset contains these key columns:
- Member Year of Birth
- Member Gender
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- Trip Duration(in seconds)
- Bike ID
- Bike Share for All Trip
- Start Time
- End Time
- Start Station ID
- End Station ID
- Start Station Name
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
