# Communicate Data Findings
In this project, I wanted to look at the characteristics of Ford GoBike system data covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The main focus was on days of the week, hours of the day, trip duration, user type, user age, and gender.
It is was implemented using Python language, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy under Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity!
